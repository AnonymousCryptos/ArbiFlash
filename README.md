# ArbiFlash
ArbiFlash is a smart contract project exploring opportunities in flash loan arbitrage. The goal is to experiment with automated strategies that can identify and act on short-term price differences across decentralized finance platforms.

This repository will eventually contain the core contracts, scripts, and tools needed to deploy and test arbitrage strategies safely on testnets.

The focus for now is on laying the groundwork, researching protocols, and building a solid understanding of flash loan mechanics and security considerations.

**Note:** This project is still in the brainstorming phase, so the content here will evolve over time as ideas are tested and refined.
