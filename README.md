# ArbiFlash

ArbiFlash is a smart contract project focused on exploring flash loan arbitrage opportunities. The idea is to experiment with automated strategies that can spot and take advantage of short-term price differences across decentralized finance platforms.

Over time, this repository will include the core contracts, scripts, and tools required to deploy and test arbitrage strategies safely on testnets.

Right now, the priority is building a strong foundation: researching different protocols, understanding how flash loans work in practice, and paying close attention to security considerations.

**Note:** This project is still in the brainstorming stage, so the content will continue to evolve as ideas are tested and refined by the creator.
